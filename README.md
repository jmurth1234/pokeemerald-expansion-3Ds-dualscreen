# Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen

A native Nintendo 3DS port of Pokémon Emerald that uses both screens: the
game on the top screen with an optional 3D (voxel) overworld, and a touch
interface on the bottom screen that replaces the START menu.

## Features

- **Native 3DS homebrew**: runs on the console's ARM11 (libctru, Citro2D and
  Citro3D), not through an emulator.
- **Two screens**: the game keeps the top screen; the bottom screen is a touch
  interface that takes the place of the START menu.
- **Optional voxel overworld**: the top screen can show the overworld in 3D,
  with modelled buildings, trees, signposts and terrain relief. It is off by
  default: turn on **VOXEL 3D** in the bottom screen's OPTION screen, where
  **3D ANGLE** and **3D ZOOM** then adjust its camera.
- **Your own data**: the game data is built on your computer from your own
  cartridge dump; nothing from the ROM is distributed.

## Current scope of the 3D mode

The modelled part of the voxel overworld is still limited. Only some
buildings, trees, signposts and relief are modelled today; **most of the map
and nearly all interiors are still shown flat**. More areas will be modelled
as the project moves forward.

## About this repository

**This repository contains no game content.** It holds the port's own code,
the tools that build it and the builder that turns *your own* cartridge dump
into the game's data pack. Nothing derived from the ROM is distributed here or
in the releases.

- Engine: [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation,
  pinned in [`upstream.lock`](upstream.lock), plus the port's changes in
  [`patches/pokeemerald/`](patches/pokeemerald). The port also builds on
  [rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion)
  (`expansion/1.17.0`, patches in
  [`patches/pokeemerald-expansion/`](patches/pokeemerald-expansion)).
- Port: [`3ds_port/`](3ds_port) — ARM11 backend (libctru, Citro2D/Citro3D),
  GPU compositor, NDSP audio, bottom-screen UI, voxel overworld.
- Data: generated on the player's computer by the
  [Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen Builder](builder/) from a Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) ROM.

## Playing

For full installation, sound and update instructions, see
[Install and update](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

You need a 3DS/2DS family console with custom firmware (Luma3DS) and the
Homebrew Launcher, and a clean dump of your own Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe)
cartridge (SHA-1 `f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`).

1. Download `Emerald3DS-vX.Y.Z-Windows.zip` from the releases and extract it.
2. Run `Emerald3DS-Builder.exe`, choose your ROM and your SD card, press
   **Install**.
3. Start **Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen** from the Homebrew Launcher.

The builder writes `/3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.3dsx`, `Emerald3DS.smdh` and
`emerald3ds.pak`. The ROM is only read: it is not copied, uploaded or modified,
and no Internet connection is involved. Each release comes with its own
builder; after updating, run it again (the game tells you when the data pack
does not match the release).

On Linux and macOS the builder runs from source:
`python -m emerald3ds_builder install --rom <ROM> --sd <card>` (see
[builder/](builder/)).

## Building from source

```
python tools/bootstrap.py        # pinned upstream + patches + port -> build/upstream
python tools/bootstrap.py --make # also builds the 3DSX there

# the same port on pokeemerald-expansion (build/upstream by default):
python tools/bootstrap.py --upstream pokeemerald-expansion --make
```

Requirements, the development loop (loose data, data packs, host tests) and
the release process are in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md). How the pieces fit together is in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/ASSET_PIPELINE.md](docs/ASSET_PIPELINE.md).
