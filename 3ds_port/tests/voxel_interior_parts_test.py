"""The furniture parts of gen_voxel_buildings.interior_specs, on synthetic
drawings: a side dressed as its front's casing (plain_side); a table told
standing on its legs (leg_split) and built as a top on posts, a pedestal
and an apron (table_plan, table_parts), its top's side what its front shows
under the same edge (slab_side), and still its drawing, pixel for pixel, at
45 degrees (voxel_building.ortho_check); a top against a wall lying flat
(voxel_building.Relief `against`); a piece's pixels as its outline
delimits them (outline_trim); what is drawn no deeper than its front
(is_flat); a frame seen through from behind as from before (Relief
`see_through`); a dome, round and still its drawing at 45 degrees
(dome_fit, voxel_building.ProjDome); a glass table's feet a row tall
(leg_split `explicit`); an escalator built from the side, its slopes
its own and its drawing at 45 degrees (voxel_building.ProjRun); a counter
modelled whole on its U of a plan, its corners cut on the slant and the
yard between its arms open (voxel_building.PlanPrism); a ball, round and
its circle at 45 degrees (ball_fit); a jar turned, its belly and neck
as drawn (lathe_fit); a card lifted onto a stand (Card `base`); what of
a stand's shape is its top,
not the pots in a row on it (support_left `sibs`), nor the room round it
a pot's (auto_leave); what a ball hides of the arm it
stands on, that arm's own column (fill_hidden "column"); and a stool in
blocks, its cushion's corners cut on its base and foot, its drawing at 45
degrees and each hidden side a quad of its wide strip
(voxel_building_specs.center_stool)."""
