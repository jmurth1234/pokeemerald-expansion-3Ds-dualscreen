"""Find the faults of the voxel models without looking for them by eye.

The proofs of gen_voxel_buildings.py only see the GBA's 45-degree view: a
model can match its drawing pixel for pixel there and still look wrong from
the game's camera, because every face the drawing does not show (sides,
backs, undersides, the real depth) is invented. This scan measures every
triangle of every model placed in a layout and flags what goes wrong on
those invented faces:

    stretch   one texel smeared over several pixels in one direction (a
              column or a row pulled along a face): texels per pixel along
              the face's weaker axis below --stretch (default 0.4)
    ground    a face standing up (not a top) textured with the ground round
              the model (grass, paving, water): the drawing's ground leaking
              into a wall
    holes     a face with many transparent texels: seen through from the
              game's camera, though at 45 degrees something hid it
    steps     tiny facets: a curved object built in stair steps (boats,
              bushes); scored per model as small triangles per square pixel
              of surface
    thin      a part narrower than --thin pixels on the ground plan and
              taller than it is wide modelled as a box: from the game's
              camera its sides repeat its front (posts, legs)

A room's pieces (gen_voxel_buildings.interior_specs) are judged further, by
what their spec's "lint" knows of them - which pixels are theirs, what they
stand on, what their sides are dressed with:

    stripes   a side dressed with a stretch of the front that changes colour
              column after column: laid along the side, a barcode (the
              television's side, a chair's back)
    copied    a side dressed with a stretch of the front that carries its
              drawing - outline lines across or down it: the drawers seen
              again on the desk's end
    foreign   a hidden face (side, back, the depth behind the drawing)
              reading what is not the piece's own: the floor, the room
              round it, empty texels (fins at a chair's legs)
    dark      a side dressed almost all in one dark colour: a black slab
    under     a front whose lowest rows are the floor, the rug or the shadow
              under a table: the room's floor stood up as a wall
    bleed     a piece standing on another that carries its support's colours
              (the desk's top on the front of a book)
    cut       a support with holes where what stands on it took its pixels
    flat      a piece with no depth at all: a paper plane (a chair's back)
    backdrop  a piece carrying the room round it - the wall seen behind a
              computer's corners: at 45 degrees it lies on the wall, from
              the game's camera it stands on the piece (its top laid with it)
    card_bg   a card (a plant) carrying the room's wall or floor
    floating  a piece lifted onto nothing

Cards are leaves on a transparent card: their holes are not faults.

Writes DIR/report.txt (every model, its flagged faces by kind and tag) and,
for every --view, DIR/<name>.png (the scene from the game's camera) and
DIR/<name>_flags.png (the same with every flagged face tinted: red stretch,
blue ground, magenta holes, yellow steps, cyan thin; orange stripes, sand
copied, green foreign, grey dark, brown under, lime bleed, violet cut, pink flat, sky
backdrop, teal card_bg, white floating). With no --view, one view per model placed, framed
on it. --console: the follow camera of src/voxel/voxel_camera.c instead -
yaw 0, the player's pitches, the distance it gives the layout's size - from
six places in the layout, as a room is reviewed. --only builds only the
models whose names start with the prefixes (a room that stands another
room's pieces, May's house, needs both).

--cache keeps the built models (pickled) so that a second scan does not
rebuild them; delete it after changing a spec.
