"""The Seaside Cycling Road: a deck on piers, read off its own drawing.

Route 110's cycling road is a bridge. The cartridge says so itself: its deck
is elevation 4 over the elevation-3 land and the elevation-1 sea, and where a
path or the sea passes under it the cells are elevation 15 - walked over at
4, walked or surfed under at 3 or 1. A height field (relief.bin) cannot hold
that: a cell has one height. So the road is a model, like a building, with
open space under it, and the console lifts whoever is up on it (the deck
table of buildings.bin, `decks()` below).

The drawing
-----------
An Emerald drawing is what an orthographic camera at 45 degrees sees: a
point (X, Y, Z) - pixels, X east, Y up, Z south - lands on the art at
u = X, v = Z - Y (voxel_building.py). The road is drawn with:

  the deck     its road surface (two light colours in stripes), ringed by a
               dark outline (62627b) that runs along the foot of the rails
  the rails    13 rows of railing standing on the deck's edge: north of the
               road above its outline, south of it on the road's last rows;
               west and east a strip seen from above
  the front    under the south rail: the kerb (the outline again), the
               girder, and every few cells a pier: its head and a truss
               down to the water
  the ramps    where the road comes down to the land at the gatehouses, the
               road's stripes turn across

Every pixel of it is placed by that rule: the road at the deck's height H,
the south rail, girder and piers on one upright face at the deck's south
edge, the north rail on one at its north edge, the side rails as their tops
H + RAIL over the deck's sides. Seen at 45 degrees it is the drawing; seen
from the game's camera it stands on its piers with the sea under it.

Its height
----------
The piers end 42 rows under the kerb, so the drawing's deck stands 42 px
over the water. Its ramps cannot: they are drawn three cells long, and
exact at 45 degrees they would fall 42 px in 6 - a wall. The deck stands at
DECK (40 px, two and a half levels): the trusses' last two rows would stand
under the water and are laid on it instead. A ramp ends where it is drawn
ending, on the row its foot is drawn on, and comes down over RAMP_RUN
pixels: so it begins up in the deck, three rows over its drawn top, and
falls in a slot cut through the deck's south edge - its rows, the deck's
road over its drawn top among them, laid exactly at 45 degrees. The slot's
sides are walls (RAMP_SIDE thick, where the rails are drawn coming down
beside it) from the ground to the deck, and the deck's front runs straight
on over them to the slot (`_corner`): the drawing turns its rail down the
ramp in a curve, which in the deck's corner stood as a staircase of road
and a rail sticking out over the slot. On the grass at the foot nothing of
it stands (a ramp laid on two cells more of it, its parapets standing on
cells walked by, stood in the trainer by Route 110's southern ramp and in
the fence by its northern one). Under the deck there is room for a walker:
the girder takes GIRDER px under the deck's edges, the deck between them is
a slab of SLAB px.

Its corners
-----------
A corner is drawn as a staircase of pixels; built as one it would be a
staircase of walls. So a front turning at a corner is a wall at 45 degrees
(every column of it showing its own drawn rows), a side rail's strip ends
cut along the same diagonal (`_strips`: at an inner corner the road drawn
against the strip's head is laid on it, at an outer one its head runs to the
end of the drawing and its foot is cut by the front's chamfer), and the
strip's rows meet their neighbours' edges halfway, through no pixel's
middle; a row of the strip takes all of its own pixels (where the road
widens at an inner corner one row took its columns from a shorter run, a
notch in the rail's side). The corners on the deck's north side, its inner
ones on its south side and a ramp's corners are built square instead
(`_north_corner`, `_inner_north_corner`, `_south_corner`, `_corner`):
there the drawing rounds the rail, and built as drawn a column of the rail
stood up past it like a post, the strip's head rose in a staircase and a
crack stood between them; turning into a strip the front's girder, its
stripes drawn across the turn, was a wall of teeth. The flank going on
straight there is laid at the map's own phase, its posts where the drawn
rail's stand. Only the outer corners on the south side keep their chamfer.
The piers drawn beside a span are boxes standing in the water (`_pier`).

What it stands among
--------------------
Its cells draw more than the bridge: a shore's edge, a tree's leaves over
the rail, the long grass a span shades, a pile's edge in the shadowed
water's colour. Whatever of a cell's drawing is not the bridge's and not
the plain ground the model lays under it is laid on that ground as drawn,
a ground patch of the placement (`lay`): the console lights a patch as the
terrain, so the deck's shadow falls across it (a model's own faces take
the sun's facing alone). Nothing of the drawing is lost. A lawn's curb
that goes on under a span is no part of the bridge either (`_curbs`): it
runs on under the deck as the `curb` component builds it beside, the
stones the drawing shows its own. The houses beside the road are named
(`apart`): a door's reach through the blocked cells (voxel_cells houses)
runs on into the deck's front.

Its hidden faces
----------------
A model is proved alone without the faces the drawing never shows (~depth:
a side's rail and girder, the slab under the deck, the road under the south
rail). They must still stand behind what is drawn, model by model:
`_cut_corners` cuts them at an outer corner's chamfer and under the end of
its drawing, and they stand a hair back from the faces
they meet (INSET, BEHIND) so no pixel is a tie. gen_voxel_buildings
`bridge_check` lays every model in the map with all its faces and its
patches over the ground each placement lays, and holds them to the
drawing pixel for pixel.
